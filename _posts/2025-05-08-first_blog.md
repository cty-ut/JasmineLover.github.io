First, the inrtoduction of myself: A ordinary person who wants to do a little change to the world.  I'm conducting the research of chemisrty in the university of Tokyo, I don't know if it is too late for starting the study of software development. Chemistry is funny, AI, software are alse funny. But for work, I intend to do the job of software development. By using LLM, I believe I can develop some really good product for world. I hope that even a little bit, some people's lives will be changed because of my work.

## Previous Study
I started to learn coding a few months ago. In my college, I have learned C++ and Python, so I continue to study some packages in Python, including pandas, numpy, pytorch and so on. Nowadays, it is unwise to learn code simply by following a textbook, with the help of LLM, the efficiency can be improved incredibly. In the future, AI will cover more fields, and totally change our life. By using LLM, we can create endless interesting products that we can't even imagine. For us, the really job is accelerating this process: AI products will finally enter all aspects of life. Like Elon Musk said:

> “I think really the goal of Tesla Motors is to help accelerate the advent of the electric vehicle.”

I'm waiting for the arrival of this day.

## Current work
### Project
Fortunately, I am now living a fulfilling life with goals and direction. After learning Python, I develop a simple chatbot by using streamlit and API from openai. It can chat, upload files, analyse pictures by YOLOv8, that's kinds of simple functions. This is my first project, it is very simple but I gained a great sense of accomplishment from this project. I konw that is what I really love. By imporving my code ability(also by enriching my profile), I plan to do some extended works. It can not be really used by people because it just, simply use the LLM of Openai, I need to do some different. 'Study chatbot' is a good choice. By using RAG, materials can be uploaded and personalized answer is possible.
Literally it can help students and researchs to understand courses and papers faster. Depending on the materials uploaded, AI can generate more specific answers.

### Study
I wish I'm a student in major of computer science, but I'm not. Continuous learing is essential. Leetcode is a good website to practice algorithm. Some lectures in internet are very easy for zero_based to learn.
Goal: Machine learing, Data structure, Microcomputer principles
Here is a vedio I recommend which simply explains neural network：

### Others
I'm in the major of chemistry and live in Japan, so I also need to do experiments and learn Japanese(and English of crouse). A flood of work overwhelmed me, but it didn't break me. I found fulfillment in a busy and meaningful life - it's far better than wasting days doing nothing.

May we all keep growing—quietly, steadily, into the people we hope to become.
